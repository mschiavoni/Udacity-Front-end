Bears, Beets, Battlestar Galactica
===============================
Objective: Dwight Schrute has a huge karate tournament.  But first, he must get to his beet farm as many times as possible for good luck and the powerful smell of beets.  Stay clear of the bears and try and navigate Dwight to his beet farm on the other side of the board. 

How to play: You can navigate Dwight left, right, up, and down by using the arrow keys. Your opponent is the bears, which move at varying degrees of speed. If Dwight comes in contact with a bear, he loses and the game resets back to the beginning.  Dwight wins if he can get across the board and make contact with his beet farm.
