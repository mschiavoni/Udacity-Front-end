Objective: Dwight Schrute has a 12 and up karate tournament.  But first, he must visit his beet farm for good luck. Get Dwight to the his beet farm on the other side of the board. Stay clear of the bears.

Instructions: You can navigate Dwight left, right, up, and down by using the arrow keys on your keyboard. Although Dwight loves bears, almost as much as he loves the law, you need to navigate him around the board to the other side without coming in contact with any bears. If Dwight comes in contact with a bear, he loses and the game resets to the beginning.  Dwight wins if he gets across the board and makes contact with his beet farm.
